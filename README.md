# HandiCar
The HandiCar project is a gesture-operated vehicle system designed for hands-free control using an MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor. The system translates hand movements into wireless commands via Bluetooth, enabling precise robotic vehicle control. It is particularly beneficial for individuals with physical disabilities and has applications in assistive mobility, industrial automation, and smart transportation. The system consists of gesture input, processing, communication, control, motion, and power management. Real-time obstacle detection ensures smooth navigation, while LED indicators provide real-time feedback on motion and system status. The car is designed to recognize commands for forward, backward, left, right, and stop, with an emergency stop function activated when obstacles are detected within a defined range. 
 
The project utilizes a microcontroller-based architecture integrated with open-source software, ensuring cost-effective implementation and scalability. The software optimizes motor control algorithms, distinguishing between valid gestures and unintended movements. The system also features voice command integration as a backup control mechanism, enhancing accessibility and usability. Compliant with ISO standards for gesture recognition, obstacle detection, and software quality, the HandiCar project prioritizes safety and efficiency. Future improvements include AI-driven gesture refinement, increased autonomy, and advanced obstacle avoidance techniques. With potential applications in autonomous vehicles and assistive robotics, HandiCar represents a step forward in intuitive human-machine interaction.
